# Fractal-Harmonic-Generator

Fractal Harmonic Generator  
Core Concept: Generate evolving harmonics using fractal equations, where sounds mirror self-similar, recursive patterns creating infinitely complex and evolving soundscapes.

Key features include:  
• Fractal Equation-Based Harmonic Generation – Use customizable fractal algorithms for increasingly complex harmonic content.  
• Self-Similarity Modulation – Introduce recursive structures in sound design, with parameters controlling the degree of self-similarity and evolution over time.  
• Chaos Control – Allow precise adjustment of fractal depth and unpredictability, enabling shifts from subtle textural enhancement to wild, chaotic soundscapes.

Additional features:  
• Parameter Flexibility – Consider offering multiple fractal algorithms (e.g., Mandelbrot-inspired, Julia sets) and iterations, so users can choose their preferred complexity and visual (or audible) structure.  
• Visual Feedback – Including a real-time graphical display of the fractal pattern can help users understand how parameter changes affect the generated sound.  
• MIDI Integration & DAW Automation – Enable mapping of fractal controls to MIDI controllers and DAW automation for dynamic performances.  
• Presets and Save/Load Options – Create a bank of presets for quick starting points along with the ability to save custom settings.
