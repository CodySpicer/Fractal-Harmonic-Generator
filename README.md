# Fractal-Harmonic-Generator
Generates harmonics based on fractal mathematics, creating infinitely complex and evolving soundscapes.

Features of the Fractal Harmonic Generator:

Fractal Equation-Based Harmonic Generation: Utilizing fractal algorithms to produce harmonics that evolve in complexity over time.
Self-Similarity Modulation: Implementing recursive sound structures that mirror fractal patterns, adding depth and variation.
Chaos Control: A parameter allowing users to adjust the fractal depth and unpredictability, ranging from subtle enhancements to chaotic textures.

The Fractal Harmonic Generator represents a novel approach to sound design, offering musicians and producers a tool to explore new sonic territories through the application of fractal mathematics.
